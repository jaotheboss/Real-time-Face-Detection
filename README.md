# Real-time-Face-Detection
Python code for real-time face detection using your computer's webcam

## Description:
When the python script is executed on your computers' Terminal, it should open your webcam and be able to detect both your eyes and your face

Something to note is that you have to set a specific directory for the caascade model file for both faces and eyes. These files contain pre-trained weights that allows the machine learning model recognize eyes and faces. 

I've tried to annotate the code as much as I can such that it would be easy for anyone to understand each individual step of the code.

## Execution:
1. Simply running the python script should do it.
2. However, if that doesn't work. Open your Terminal
3. Change the directory on Terminal to the folder that holds this python script
4. Type in `python face_detection.py`
